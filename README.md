# Stock-Analysis
## Overview of Project
In this project I created an easy to view VBA so Steve can analyze some green stocks performance showing daily volume and annual return. I used macros with 2017 and 2018 data and highlighted rate of returns which should help him narrow down the stocks he would like to invest in. I refactored my code in order to increase the efficiency of my analysis. 
## Results 
I came to several conclusions based on the data given to me by using tickers to determine the type of stock that was being displayed. The stock categories from 2017 tended to have a successful return. However, in the year 2018, only two of the twelve stock types had a positive return.
### Refactoring the Code
I had to switch the nesting order of my loops in order to make my code more efficient. I created four arrays consisting of tickers, tickervolumes, tickerstartingprices, and tickerendingprices. I used tickers array to establish the ticker symbol of each stock. I matched up the remaining arrays with ticker array with the variable tickerIndex. Using this variable made it easier for me to assign tickervolumes, tickerstartingprices, and tickerendingprices to each stockâ€™s ticker symbol. I found this method to be much more efficient compared to nested loop. 
#### Refactored Code

    Dim tickers(12) As String
    
    tickers(0) = "AY"
    tickers(1) = "CSIQ"

    tickers(3) = "ENPH"
    tickers(4) = "FSLR"
    tickers(5) = "HASI"
    tickers(6) = "JKS"
    tickers(7) = "RUN"
    tickers(8) = "SEDG"
    tickers(9) = "SPWR"
    tickers(10) = "TERP"
    tickers(11) = "VSLR"

        '3b) Check if the current row is the first row with the selected tickerIndex.
        'If  Then

            '3d Increase the tickerIndex.

            tickerIndex = tickerIndex + 1
        
        End If
    
    Next i
    
      '4) Loop through your arrays to output the Ticker, Total Daily Volume, and Return.

# Summary
## Advantages or Disadvantages of refactoring code
### Advantages
  Refactoring code is advantages because it is more efficient and easier to debug if there is an issue with the VBA code. It is making the run time faster. This can be very important especially when working with extremely large datasets.
### Disadvantages
  The disadvantage of refactoring code is it is not a new code so there is always the possibility of fixing additional bugs if it is refactored.  

# Advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script 
  I noticed that refactored code reduced the number of loops which increased efficiency. Refactored code also maximized the VBA code which led to less run time if we compare it to the original code. Although I favored the refactored code, one can make a case for added runtime and more time spent on debugging if the data set and the analysis was more complex.
